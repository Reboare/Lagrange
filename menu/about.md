I'm a penetration tester living in the United Kingdom. Currently focussing on web applications, infrastructure and cloud, with a goal to move to red-teaming in the future.

I'm currently OSCP certified and working towards CRT and SLAE. If you're interesting in contacting me, LinkedIn and Twitter are good avenues, but feel free to shoot me an email too.
